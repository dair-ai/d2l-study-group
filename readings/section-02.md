# Chapter 2: Deep Learning Preliminaries
In this chapter, you will be covering a few prelinaries that will help you develop basic skills needed to get started with deep learning. Some of these important preliminaries include data manipulation, data processing, linear algebra, calculus, automatic differentiation, and probability.
